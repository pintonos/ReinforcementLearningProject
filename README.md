# ReinforcementLearningProject
The aim of this project is to train agents using Reinforcement Learning algorithms for solving the acrobot task. For this, we implement 3 different RL algorithms that are capable of solving environments with continuous states and discrete actions.

- Semi-gradient SARSA OR Q-Learning with a neural network as the function approximator
- A modern deep RL algorithm of your choice which makes use of value functions (e.g. DQN, any actor-critic RL algorithm, etc.)
- MuZero
