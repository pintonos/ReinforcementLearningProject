# ReinforcementLearningProject
The aim of this project is to train agents using Reinforcement Learning algorithms for solving the acrobot task. For this, we implement 3 different RL algorithms that are capable of solving environments with continuous states and discrete actions.

- Semi-gradient SARSA OR Q-Learning with a neural network as the function approximator
- DQN
- AC2
