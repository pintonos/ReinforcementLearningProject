## README for Deep Q-Learning

### Setup

The setup is straight forward. Just open the notebook and execute every cell. All required packages should get installed automatically. The parameters for the agent can be changed in the cell after the Q-Learning class.

### What does the notebook do?

* create a gym enviroment (Acrobot-v1)
* create an agent and trains him using Q-Learning with a neural network as the function approximator 
* print the average reward of last 100 episodes
* plot the results
